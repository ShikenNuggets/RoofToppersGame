# Roof Toppers

Created by Devon Ly, Jared Fukumoto, Sean Gallagher, and Carter Rennick.

Roof Toppers is a 3D physics-based platformer where you grapple across buildings to deliver pizza in the serene aftermath of an apocalyptic flood. This game was created as part of a capstone project for the Humber College Game Programming advanced diploma. It created using the [PizzaBox Game Engine](PizzaBox), created by the same team between 2017 and 2019.

## Archive Note ##
This is a mirror of the original Bitbucket repository. It exists purely for historical completeness and archival reasons. The project officially ended in 2019. It has not been and will no longer be maintained. I am very happy with what we were able to accomplish with relatively little time and no real experience, but realistically, this is still very much a student project. I do not recommend using or studying this code.
